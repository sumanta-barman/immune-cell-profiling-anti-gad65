# immune-cell-profiling-anti-gad65

This repository contains all analysis code associated with the preprint **"Immune cell profiling reveals expanded stem cell-like memory T cells in anti-GAD65-associated neurological syndromes"** 

## Overview

The code in this repository reproduces the main computational analyses in the manuscript, including: 
- Preprocessing and quality control of CSF and blood single-cell RNA-seq and BCR/TCR seq data.
- Clustering and annotation of immune cell populations.
- Analysis of T cell clonal expansion and proinflammatory gene expression.
- Integration of B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire data and identification of GAD65-reactive B cell clones.
- Generation of figures and summary statistics reported in the article.
